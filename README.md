A repository to hold my understanding of the design patterns from the Head First Design Patterns book

## Design Principles

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what remains the same.
2. Program to an interface, not to an implementation. (This means program to a supertype.)
3. Favor composition over inheritance.

## Design Patterns

### Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, & makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
