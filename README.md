# design-patterns-java

A repository to hold my understanding of the design patterns from the Head First Design Patterns book

## Design Principles

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what remains the same.
2. Program to an interface, not to an implementation. (This means program to a supertype.)
3. Favor composition over inheritance.

4. Strive for loose coupled design between objects that interact.

## Design Patterns

### Strategy Pattern

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, & makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### Observer Pattern

The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state
all of its dependents are notified & updated automatically.
