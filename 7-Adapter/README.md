# Adapter and Facade Pattern

Think of a power adapter.
The adapter pattern converts the interface of one class into one that the client is expecting.

There are 2 kinds of adapters:

1. Object adapters
2. Class adapters (needs multiple inheritance which is *NOT* supported by Java)

Facade patterns provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Think of the home theatre example where you have to turn on a lot of things before settling down to watch a movie.
Imagine now, hitting a watch movie button that initiates all the settings.
