# Proxy pattern

It provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

The pattern typically involves creating a proxy class that implements the same interface as the real object and delegates the real work to the actual object.

## Steps

1. Define the subject interface
2. Implement the real subject
3. Implement the proxy
4. Use the proxy pattern
