# Factory Pattern

All factory patterns encapsulate object creation.

## Abstract Factory

Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Procedure

1. Define the Shape Interface

2. Implement Concrete Shapes

3. Create the Factory Class

4. Use the Factory to Create Objects

## Factory Method

Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.

### Steps

1. Define the Product Interface

2. Implement Concrete Products

3. Define the Creator Abstract Class

4. Implement Concrete Creators

5. Use the Factory Method Pattern
