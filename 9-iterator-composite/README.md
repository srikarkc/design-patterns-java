# Iterator pattern

The iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

It involves an 'iterator' interface that defines methods for accessing and traversing the elements in a collection.

## Steps

1. Define the interator interface.
2. Define the aggregate interface.
3. Implement concrete collection and iterator.
4. Use the iterator pattern

# Composite Pattern

Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree-like structure to represent part-whole hierarchies.

Example, a directory can contain both files and directories. Using the composite pattern, you can treat both uniformly.

## Steps

1. Define the Component interface
2. Implement the Leaf class
3. Implement the Composite class
4. Use the composite pattern
