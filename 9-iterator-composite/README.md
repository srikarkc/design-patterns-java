# Iterator pattern

The iterator pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying structure.

It involves an 'iterator' interface that defines methods for accessing and traversing the elements in a collection.

## Steps

1. Define the interator interface.
2. Define the aggregate interface.
3. Implement concrete collection and iterator.
4. Use the iterator pattern
