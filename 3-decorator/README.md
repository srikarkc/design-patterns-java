# Decorator Pattern

Our goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behavior without modifying existing code.

Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilites to an object dynamically. They provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extended functionality.

The Decorators have the same supertype as the object they are decorating.

## Procedure

1. Create the Component Interface (Coffee)

2. Implement the concrete component

3. Create the Decorator abstract class

4. Implement the concrete decorators
