# Template Method Pattern

Template method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

It promotes code reuse and ensures that the invariant parts of the algorithm are implemented once in a base class.

## Steps

1. Define the Abstract class
2. Implement concrete subclasses
3. Use the template method pattern
